class Game
  # TODO needs to inherit from ActiveRecord Base

  # def game_over!
  #   @game_over = true
  # end
end



# next steps

# call Game.game_over! method from controller

# need to implement a sessions controller to handle login and return player

# need to implement database with Active Record

# when you are checking if either has won - don't recheck each position each time - use hash of values

# have a current player which you switch with starter player to alternate moves
